Cardtainers is a firefox extension that I wasted time on to prevent the need to generate containerise rules every time you make a new puppet. The way it works is by taking an input of puppet names through a textarea when you click the extension icon, then matching the url for /nation= and /container= for each nation, and either creates a container and opens that tab in the new container, or opens the tab in an existing container.

Use Cardtainers if you don't want to generate container rules all the time, especially if you found nations very often.

## Differences

Generation of container rules is no longer necessary, you just need to paste in a list of your puppets into the text area under the extension toolbar button like
    
    ```
    kazakhstan
    norway
    puppet farmer 1
    ```

This helps a lot for people who found puppets often, as container rule generation can be a nuisance.

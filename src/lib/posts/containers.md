There are a lot of ways to manage puppets, like using keybinds to switch between nations, or other tools for puppet management. One of the more effective ways, especially for card farming, is through the use of the extension Containerise.

### What is a container?
A container is an isolated instance on a browser, which couples its own cookies, sessions, and state, independent from the other sessions or tabs outside of the container. This means that for NationStates, you can have multiple containers configured to be logged on to different accounts.

### How can I get started?
I don't want to rewrite an already amazing guide, so use <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1383002" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this guide by Racoda</a> to get started.

If you are unwilling to install python to generate the rules, you can essentially skip Step 2 of the guide by visiting <a href="https://hare.vercel.app/tools/containerise/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hare's Containerise rule generator</a> or using <a href="/guides/cardtainers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardtainers</a>.
